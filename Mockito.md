# Mockito Mocks #

Dexmaker includes class proxy support for [Mockito](http://code.google.com/p/mockito/). Add the mockito and the dexmaker `.jar` files to your Android test project's `libs/` directory and you can use Mockito in your Android unit tests.

This relies on unreleased Mockito APIs (as of March 5, 2012). You'll need to build your own mockito .jar until these APIs are released!
